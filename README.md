Welcome to my portfolio! This repository contains all the projects that I have worked on.

## Full Stack Web Development Overview

As a Full Stack Web Developer, I have experience in both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to see projects from the conceptual stage to final deployment. My goal is to build responsive and efficient web applications that offer seamless user experiences.

### Front-end

I have proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as modern libraries and frameworks such as React.js and Vue.js. My focus is on creating interactive and responsive UIs that are user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.

### Back-end

On the back-end side, I'm proficient in Node.js and Python, using frameworks such as Express.js and Django for server-side logic. I am also familiar with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, ensuring data persistence and efficient retrieval.

### DevOps

In addition to development, I have experience with DevOps practices like continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) using tools like Jenkins and Travis CI. I am familiar with Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration. I've also worked with cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure for deploying and managing applications.

### Version Control

Version control is a key aspect of my development process. I have experience with Git for version control, enabling me to efficiently manage and track changes to projects, work collaboratively, and maintain a clean and manageable codebase.

I'm constantly learning and staying updated with the latest trends in web development to ensure I'm able to create efficient and modern applications.```
